                         A FRIENDLY GUIDE TO OUR PANDA! 🐼


Hi there! Welcome to Quinzex! Let me tell you all about
this super cool website like I'm telling my best friend.

1. THE MAGIC PANDA 🐼
Imagine having a giant robot panda that lives inside 
your computer screen. He has super soft fur that looks 
real! If you touch him or click on him, your phone 
will even "buzz" like he's saying hello!

2. HE'S A COPYCAT! 🤳
If you click the "NEURAL CAM" button, something 
magical happens. If you look up, the panda looks up. 
If you look left, he looks left. And the best part?
If you wave your hand at him, HE WAVES BACK! It's 
like he's your digital twin.

3. PHONE REMOTE CONTROL 📱
If you use this on your phone, your phone becomes a 
remote control! You can tilt your phone up, down, 
left, or right, and the panda will follow along. 
On your laptop, he just loves following your 
mouse cursor everywhere you go.

4. SUPER SECRET AGENT STUFF 🕵️
Our panda is like a secret agent. He uses the camera 
to see your moves, but he never saves anything! 
No videos are ever recorded or sent away. He just 
plays with you and forgets everything once you 
stop. Your secrets are safe with him!

5. WHY IS IT SO COOL? 🚀
Everything on this page is made to feel smooth and 
fast, like a futuristic video game. We even made a 
special target cursor for your mouse so you can 
feel like an explorer!

HAVE FUN PLAYING! 🎈

-- With love from the Quinzex Team!
